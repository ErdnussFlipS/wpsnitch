This is the Google App Engine app that runs on https://wpsnitch.appspot.com/

If you want to create your own app or service to retrieve this information,
read the code and replicate its behaviour--please, don't use the appspot
website as an API! It's on the free tier of App Engine and its quota is very
limited.

The code is here, but GitLab is fucking dumb and does not show the file list
on the main page of the project. Click "Files", in the sidebar, to see it.

Everything is in the public domain, do whatever you want with the code.
